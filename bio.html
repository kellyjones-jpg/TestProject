    <p>I am a Web Editor for Leidos who holds the Antarcitc Support Contract, so I get to support science in Antarctica. I am responsible for maintaining
        content for public and private sites; this includes our public site <a href="https://www.usap.gov/">USAP.gov</a>
        as well as our station intranets.</p>

    <p>My first <em>big project</em> was rolling out the South Pole intranet at the bottom of the world. I had my 24th
        birthday at the South Pole. I think that's pretty cool.</p>
